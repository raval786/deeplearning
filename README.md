depplearning algorithms.
<p><b>Deep Learning</b>is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the brain called <b>artificial neural networks.</b>
  <br><br>
  There are some algorithms of Deep learning 
  <br>
  a)Artificial neural network<br>
  b)Recurrent neural network<br>
  c)Convolutional neural network<br>
  d)GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)<br>
  e)Autoencoder<br>
<br><br>
  Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example.<br><br> Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers.
